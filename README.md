## 🚀 What was GemBot?

GemBot was designed to provide various features for Discord servers, including:
- **Basic command handling**  
- **User moderation tools**  
- **Simple fun commands** like `!joke`, `!quote`, and others  
- **Server statistics**  
- **Integration with external APIs** for dynamic content  

The bot utilized **discord.js** to interact with the Discord API, but due to time and prioritization, the bot was never fully finished or deployed.
